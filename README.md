# MobyUI
This is a hobby project for learning C++ and UI development with Qt. It's goal is to create a Docker Desktop for Linux, starting with basic features like listing containers, images, volumes and repositories and expanding on this.

## Project status

Just in planning + experimenting phase!

- [x] Beautiful but non functioning UI start page
- [ ] Some non functioning navigable pages
- [ ] Docker API binding
- [ ] Bringing the UI to life
- [ ] Step by step expansion of the UI

### Things I am planning to add

- Starting and stopping docker containers
- Creating new containers (maybe no full feature support and stripping down the functionality to the things which are enough for most people)
- Creating volumes
- Fast way to start favorite Docker Compose apps
- Managing registries
- Opening Docker Volume in file explorer

### Things I might add

- Viewing container logs
- Notifications for starting containers
- Managing Docker remote connections 
- Inspecting container resource usages
- Expanding the Docker feature support
